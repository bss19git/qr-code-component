## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to better center the QR code card on the page using the CSS flex feature.
I designed the page for small screen sizes using a mobile-first approach. I did not use fixed values when determining the width values. This allowed me to achieve better responsiveness.
At the same time, I learned how to better adjust the gap when using the flex-direction: column feature in CSS flex.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to work more on CSS length and width properties and develop my skills in determining which values should be used to ensure design consistency.
